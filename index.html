        <p>
            Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of<br>      
            codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.The<br>
            prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" --- and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."

            In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques<br>
            derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called<br>
            algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic<br>
            algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect<br>
            data privacy, web browsing on the internet, and confidential communications such as credit<br>
            card transactions and email.

            Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes<br>
            techniques such as microdots, merging words with images, and other ways to hide<br>
            information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is<br>
            most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext)<br>
            into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption).<br>
            Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.

            1-Confidentiality: the information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended<br>
            2-Integrity: the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended<br>
             receiver without the alteration being detected<br>
            3- Non-repudiation: the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or<br>
             her intentions in the creation or transmission of the information<br>
            4-Authentication: the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the<br>
             origin/destination of the information

            Cryptosystems use a set of procedures known as cryptographic algorithms, or ciphers, to<br>
            encrypt and decrypt messages to secure communications among computer systems,<br>
            devices such as smartphones, and applications. A cipher suite uses one algorithm for<br>
            encryption, another algorithm for message authentication, and another for key exchange.<br>
            This process, embedded in protocols and written in software that runs on operating systems<br>
            and networked computer systems, involves public and private key generation for data<br>
            encryption/decryption, digital signing and verification for message authentication, and key<br>
            exchange.

            Attackers can bypass cryptography, hack into computers that are responsible for data<br>
            encryption and decryption, and exploit weak implementations, such as the use of default<br>
            keys. However, cryptography makes it harder for attackers to access messages and data<br>
            protected by encryption algorithms.<br><br>
            Growing concerns about the processing power of quantum computing to break current<br>
            cryptography encryption standards led the National Institute of Standards and Technology<br>
            (NIST) to put out a call for papers among the mathematical and science community in 2016<br>
            for new public key cryptography standards. Unlike today's computer systems, quantum<br>
            computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can represent both 0s and 1s, and therefore<br>
            perform two calculations at once. While a large-scale quantum computer may not be built in<br>
            the next decade, the existing infrastructure requires standardization of publicly known and<br>
            understood algorithms that offer a secure approach, according to NIST. The deadline for<br>
            submissions was in November 2017, analysis of the proposals is expected to take three to<br>
            five years.

        <h2 id="CRYPTOGRAFY_HISTORY">CRYPTOGRAFY_HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
            The word "cryptography" is derived from the Greek kryptos, meaning hidden. The origin of<br>
            cryptography is usually dated from about 2000 B.C., with the Egyptian practice of<br>
            hieroglyphics. These consisted of complex pictograms, the full meaning of which was only<br>
            known to an elite few. The first known use of a modern cipher was by Julius Caesar (100 B.C. to 44 B.C.),<br>
            who did not trust his messengers when communicating with his governors and officers.<br>
            For this reason, he created a system in which each character in his messages<br>
            was replaced by a character three positions ahead of it in the Roman alphabet.<br><br>
            In recent times, cryptography has turned into a battleground of some of the world's best<br>
            mathematicians and computer scientists. The ability to securely store and transfer<br>
            sensitive information has proved a critical factor in success in war and business.<br><br>
            Because governments do not wish certain entities in and out of their countries to have<br>
            access to ways to receive and send hidden information that may be a threat to national<br>
            interests, cryptography has been subject to various restrictions in many countries, ranging<br>
            from limitations of the usage and export of software to the public dissemination of<br>
            mathematical concepts that could be used to develop cryptosystems. However, the internet<br>
            has allowed the spread of powerful programs and, more importantly, the underlying<br>
            techniques of cryptography, so that today many of the most advanced cryptosystems and<br>
            ideas are now in the public domain.
